Description
-----------
Thesis Project on Systemic Risk Assessment in Interbank Lending Networks. Done in partial fulfillment of the Bachelor
of Science program at the Amsterdam University College.

How does the model work?
------------------------
* main.py runs the simulation
* settings.py contains all parameters and constants. You may want to change your data folder here.
* controller.py controls pretty much everything that happens inside the bank network.
* other files are classes used in simulation.
